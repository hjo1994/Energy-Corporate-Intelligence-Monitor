"""Authentication/authorization via the internal eg-auth package.

Same integration form as the Digital Lab portal (and the platform template):
`authorizer()` is a FastAPI dependency (`Depends` instance) put on routers, and
`/api/auth/rights` tells the frontend what the signed-in user may do.

`eg-auth` is installed from the company mirror in the cluster; locally the stub
in `local_stubs/` stands in (EG_AUTH_DEV_MODE=True only, see its README).
